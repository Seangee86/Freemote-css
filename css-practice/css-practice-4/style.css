    > Quiz 4! In this one we already have a lot of HTML, so let's style it
    > Do not change the HTML for this one, do everything in CSS

    > First, let's style the "hero" class with the following properties
        ☑️ set a height of 30vh, width of 100%
        ☑️ download a background image from https://unsplash.com & add it to this directory
        ☑️ set the background-image property
        ☑️ use the POSITION property to center the text inside horizontally and vertically
        ☑️ HINT: you will need a second selector for H1... 
        ☑️ HINT 2: then use -> relative, absolute, top, left, and transform: translate
    .*/
    
    /*
    > Second let's...
        ☑️ style ALL "section"s with text aligned to center, 50px margin
        ☑️ style ALL "box-ctr"s with display flex, height 20vh, width 100%, background color lightgrey
    */

    /*
    > Third, let's style the "box" class
        ☑️ set a width of 5%, a height of 30%, 1px solid black border on ALL boxes
        ☑️ write 3 advanced selectors, the 1st should select the 1st box inside each box-ctr, the 2nd selects the 2nd... etc
        ☑️ using these, make first box in every container red, second green, third blue
    */

    /*
    > Last, let's style each of the box containers INDIVIDUALLY
        ☑️ We have made it easier for you with "box-ctr-n" classes
        ☑️ box-ctr-1 should look like this
            |                |
            |     [][][]     |
            |                |
        ☑️ box-ctr-2 should look like this
            |                |
            |                |
            |  []   []   []  |
        ☑️ box-ctr-3 should look like this
            |              []|
            |              []|
            |              []|
